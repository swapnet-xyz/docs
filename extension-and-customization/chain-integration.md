## üöÄ Chain Expansion

We continuously expand our chain support based on both users requests, and our own operational needs.

New EVM chain support typically takes one week or less to implement, while non-EVM chains might take longer.

To request support for a new blockchain:
- **Email**: [info@swap-net.xyz](mailto:info@swap-net.xyz?subject=Request%20for%20chain%20support)
- **Telegram**: Reach out through [our official Telegram channel](https://t.me/swapnetxyz)

### ‚ö° Low Cost Mode

For chains with limited user activity, we offer **Low Cost Mode** to keep fees minimal:

- Liquidity data is fetched on-demand when a swap request arrives
- Response time is slightly slower (~1 second)
- Enables cost-effective support for niche chains
