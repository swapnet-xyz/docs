# Competitive Performance

SwapNet outperforms other DEX aggregators through two fundamental architectural advantages that drive superior performance across all dimensions.

## Core Architectural Advantages

### 1. Mathematical Optimization vs. Strategy Sampling

Unlike traditional aggregators that rely on **strategy sampling and simulation**, SwapNet's Route Optimization Engine is built on **mathematical optimization**:

**Why This Matters:**
- **Computational Efficiency**: Mathematical optimization is far more efficient than brute-force sampling methods
- **Guaranteed Results**: Provides mathematical certainty to find the best price with given DEX pools and RFQs, rather than probabilistic approximations
- **Superior Scalability**: Performance remains consistent as liquidity sources grow, while sampling-based approaches slow down exponentially

**The Difference:** While competitors must sample and simulate thousands of potential routing strategies—a computationally expensive process—SwapNet directly computes the optimal route with mathematical guarantees.

### 2. Modularized Architecture for Liquidity Integration

SwapNet's **modularized architecture** enables seamless integration with all types of liquidity sources:

**Why This Matters:**
- **Universal Integration**: Easy connection to AMMs, RFQs, and emerging liquidity sources
- **Equivalent Liquidity Depth Improvement**: Aggregates fragmented liquidity to reduce price impact
- **Enhanced Token Coverage**: Supports trading any token with onchain liquidity, regardless of venue
- **Future-proof Extensibility**: New liquidity sources integrate without core system modifications

**The Impact:** This modular design creates a multiplicative effect on available liquidity while eliminating the typical silos that fragment DeFi markets.

## Resulting Key Advantages

These architectural foundations deliver SwapNet's three key competitive advantages:

### Lightning Fast
Mathematical optimization enables ~100ms routing calculations even with hundreds of liquidity sources, while competitors slow down as options increase.

### Better Pricing  
The optimization engine mathematically guarantees the best possible price across all available DEX pools and RFQs, unlike sampling methods that may miss optimal combinations.

### Comprehensive Coverage
Modular architecture enables access to the broadest range of liquidity sources and token pairs, supporting all tokens with any onchain liquidity.
