# Using the REST API

## Getting Your API Key

### Option 1: Telegram Bot (Recommended)

If you have a Telegram account, you can quickly obtain your API key through our [demo bot](https://t.me/SwapNetDemoBot):

1. Open the bot and navigate to the main menu
2. Select "More..."
3. Click "Get API key"

**Note:** Each Telegram account can create one API key. If you've already created a key, the bot will return your existing one.

### Option 2: Email Request

If you don't use Telegram or need additional API keys, please [request an API key](mailto:info@swap-net.xyz?subject=Request%20for%20API%20key) via email.
