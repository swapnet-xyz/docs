# DEX Integration

## Currently Supported Liquidity Sources

View all currently supported liquidity sources for each chain through the [`/chainInfo`](../aggregator-api/chainInfo.md) endpoint. This endpoint provides real-time information about integrated liquidity sources available to each router contract on a specific blockchain.

## Adding New Liquidity Sources

We continuously expand our liquidity source coverage based on user demand and our own operational requirements.

The integration timeline depends on the liquidity source's implementation. If a liquidity source is a close fork of Uniswap V2 or V3, it can typically be integrated within hours due to the standardized interface. Liquidity sources with custom architectures or unique implementations may take longer.
