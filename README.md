# What is SwapNet

SwapNet is a DEX aggregator.

Like other aggregators, SwapNet attempts to find the best price for your trade, by routing through any onchain liquidity sources, including AMMs and private market makers.

Unlike others, SwapNet is lightning fast and more likely to find an better price.

More than an aggregator, benifited from its modularized design, SwapNet provides extensible and customizable routing services for sophisticated users, including solvers, market makers, Defi protocol builders, token issuers, and chain ecosystem owners.
