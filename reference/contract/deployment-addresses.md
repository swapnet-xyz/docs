# Deployment addresses

The swapnet-router contract uses `0x616000e384Ef1C2B52f5f3A88D57a3B64F23757e` as the default deployment address across all supported EVM chains. However, on some chains, an earlier version was deployed to `0x6160006c4aa63ad1cb8cc075d99127f9d8948bb5`, which will be deprecated soon.

For the most current deployment addresses and chain-specific information, please refer to the [/chainInfo endpoint](../../aggregator-api/chaininfo.md).
